# SwiftUI Notes

## State
Binding - reference to mutable state
To combine static and dynamic views or use more than 1 group of dynamic views in a list, use `ForEach` wrapped in `List`

Use `$` to access a binding to a state variable or one of its properties. Also used for `EnvironmentObject` properties
